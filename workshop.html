        <p class="text-3 mt-20">This workshop provides clear information on how, for centuries, our communication methods have been based on the “rules of war,” 
        causing us to get defensive easily, creating destructive power struggles and much needless pain, even with those we love most. 
        We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are “good.” Traditional methods of communication – across 
        many lines of race, class, and culture – create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and 
        inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.</p>

        <p class="text-3 mt-20">Powerful Non-Defensive Communication gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. 
        Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, 
        often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform 
        relationships.</p>

        <p class="text-3 mt-20">During the course of the workshop, we’ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes 
        people commonly use. Then we’ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead 
        of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings 
        and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating 
        boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.</p>

        <p class="text-3 mt-20">We’ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. 
        The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away 
        with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.</p>

                    <p class="text-2">Vittoria is a member of the Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group http://peelcollaborative.com/. 
                        Vittoria is a Life & Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert. Vittoria has been trained by Sharon 
                        Strand Ellison to be a trainer of the PNDC model.</p>
                    <p class="text-2 mt-20">During the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, 
                        will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both 
                        professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships 
                        are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in 
                        more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to 
                        clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it 
                        contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, 
                        traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and 
                        be counterproductive.</p>
                        <p class="text-2 mt-20">Participants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:</p>

                    <p class="text-2">Financial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are 
                        often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving 
                        their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial 
                        realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or 
                        financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add 
                        additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can 
                        give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.</p>

                    <p class="text-2 mt-20">For those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also 
                        high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training 
                        programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be 
                        used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a 
                        background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at 
                        underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly 
                        without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear 
                        boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.</p>

                    <p class="text-2 mt-20">Using these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that 
                        will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client 
                        relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, 
                        creating good word of mouth advertizing.</p>

                        <h2 class="heading-2">Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>
                        <p class="text-2">As parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions 
                        for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate 
                        effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. 
                        Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don’t 
                        get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other 
                        times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.</p>

                        <p class="text-2">Using traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive 
                        and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up 
                        being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children 
                        are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.</p>

                        <p class="text-2 mt-20">A major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal 
                        interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing 
                        to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other 
                        extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of 
                        authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical 
                        maturity, and/or behavioral competence.</p>

                        <p class="text-2 mt-20">Parents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn 
                            Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently 
                            expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill

                    <h2 class="heading-2">Workshop for Couples</h2>
                    <p class="text-2">In long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often 
                        draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple 
                        has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without 
                        losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.</p>

                        <p class="text-2 mt-20">In <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication 
                        methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and 
                        vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain 
                        both independence and self-esteem.</p>

                        <p class="text-2 ">Traditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective 
                        response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply 
                        and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” 
                        and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly 
                        pervasive in the relationship.</p>

                        <p class="text-2 mt-20">Our common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties 
                            in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. 
                            Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and 
                            controlled by the other to varying degrees.
                            If couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship 
                            can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples 
                            the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process 
                            allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving

                        <p class="text-2">Click here to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, 
                        COSTI Immigration Services.</p>

                        <p class="text-2 mt-20">Organizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, 
                            whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring 
                            young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. 
                            Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as 
                            well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. 
                            The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on 
                            each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication 
                            is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.</p>

                        <p class="text-2 ">Vittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, 
                            class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,” so people get defensive instantly when they feel 
                            misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate 
                            systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive 
                            reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped 
                            human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we 
                            are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to 
                            polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.</p>

                        <p class="text-2 mt-20">In Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will 
                            learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate 
                            defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue 
                            where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for 
                            building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind 
                            of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds 
                            strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:</p>

                            <ul class="worhshopList">
                                <li class="text-2 mt-20">Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>
                                <li class="text-2">Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>
                                <li class="text-2">Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>
                                <li class="text-2">Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <p class="text-2 mt-20">Beyond simply learning isolated communication “techniques,” participants will have an 
                            opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving 
                            with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.</p>

                    <h2 class="heading-2">Workshop for Spiritual Communities</h2>
                    <p class="text-2">Our spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication 
                        can block our potential for “walking our talk” —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional 
                        relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance 
                        with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring 
                        each person’s humanity.</p>

                        <p class="text-2 mt-20">In this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all 
                            of us. You’ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more 
                            in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.</p>

                        <p class="text-2 ">Participants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for</p>

                        <ul class="worhshopList">
                            <li class="text-2 mt-20">asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>
                            <li class="text-2">giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>
                            <li class="text-2">having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>
                            <li class="text-2">creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="text-2 mt-20">You will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they 
                            respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer 
                            sessions.</p>

                        <p class="text-2 mt-20">Learning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both 
                            honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process 
                            is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded 
                            human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong 
                            spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.</p>
