INSERT INTO `bo1e_posts` VALUES (168,2,'2011-11-30 10:07:57','2011-11-30 15:07:57','I love the quote form James Borg’s book Mind Power that goes ;\r\n<blockquote>Whether you’re an optimist or a pessimist may not affect the outcome. It’s just that the optimist has a better time in life”.</blockquote>\r\nSo what are you choosing to be and did you think you were born that way? Well no actually, that’s what you are choosing for yourself, because that’s the way you are choosing to think. Unless, of course, you are remotely controlled by some unknown life force? No…. I thought not.\r\n\r\nSo obviously if you are an optimist then well done and long may it continue. However if not, and you are a glass half empty kind of person, does it make you stop and wonder how you pulled the short straw…oops there it goes again!\r\n\r\nI give full credit to James Borg for what follows and I recommend you read his book in full, it’s a potential life changer.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to recount to you now is the key to the magic box where you can retrieve your subscription papers that declare lifelong membership to the Pessimists Club. Actually it’s not so much a key as a question really and it might just change the way you see yourself and the way you justify your thoughts and your feelings to yourself.\r\n\r\nThe key question is this:<strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Do you control your mind? Or do you let your mind control you?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe are all the product of what we think, from second to second, minute to minute the incessant commentary that we create as we talk to ourselves in our heads will lead us to the actions and then create the feelings that we experience. Its worth repeating that….<strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Your thoughts come first and then feelings follow.</strong>\r\n\r\nIt is simply not possible to have a feeling without the precursor of a thought. So when we tell ourselves “I can’t help the way that I feel, it’s just the way I am and there’s nothing I can do about it”, what we are actually doing is choosing to keep ourselves boxed into that negative mindset because they are the thoughts that we are choosing for ourselves. Some even argue for their weaknesses and list reasons why they can’t improve their life, such as “it’s my upbringing” “it’s my genes”, “it’s bad luck”.\r\n\r\nHowever these things, no matter how strong, can only ever be influences upon us, they do not determine us. We always have the ability to think differently and thereby improve ourselves and our responses to all that we encounter and experience. We cannot control what happens to us or how other people treat us but we always have the freedom to choose our mental and emotional response, our outlook and attitude.\r\n\r\nSo what are you choosing? Do you think of yourself as a pessimist?\r\n\r\nDon’t forget “<strong>”whether you’re an optimist or a pessimist, may not affect the outcome. It’s just that the optimist has a better time in life”.</strong>','Optimist or Pessimist?','','publish','open','open','','optimist-or-pessimist','','','2011-11-30 12:22:36','2011-11-30 17:22:36','',0,'http://fromnowon.ca/?p=168',0,'post','',0);

Successes, however, are most often the result of the obstacles and challenges one must overcome.\n\nAt times in our lives, we find ourselves in a place where we are in need of some support. Someone to guide us through a difficult moment, someone to inspire us, someone to challenge us….or just someone to listen….with no judgement or prejudice.\n\nCounselling men and women, helping them discover their potential and their capacity to take life in their own hands, has been my life’s work and passion.\n\nAs someone who immigrated to Canada over forty years ago, involved in a bi-cultural marriage and raised two boys, I know from first-hand experience, the many barriers and challenges faced as a woman. The struggles of maintaining a “safe and happy home” combined with the need to educate myself and strike a professional career was not without hardship and personal sacrifice.\n\nAs the owner and operator of a private insurance brokerage, for about 20 years I have trained and coached my team to achieve their professional goals. In addition, through my involvement with COSTI Immigrant Services (<a href=\"http://www.costi.org\">www.costi.org</a>), I have worked with abused and immigrant women in need of support and counselling. For many women and their families, group and individual counselling is their first step towards successful integration. As the organization’s Vice President and Chair of Women’s Services, my responsibility to ensure that programs are reflective of the needs of women, has resulted in the delivery of women’s services that focus on entrepreneurship and supportive self-help programs that lead to their independence, self-empowerment and success.\n\nAs a Life Coach, my goal is to assist individuals to achieve healthy and productive lives. Through my education, personal experience and professional training, my focus and mission is to help individuals heal and release any psychological obstacles that may prevent them from achieving their goals and living their dreams.\n\nMy experiences as a mother, widow, businesswoman and caregiver have shaped my perspective on life in that I find fulfillment in helping others actualize their dreams. I firmly believe that one can serve others better if one shares personal experiences. With all the joys in my life, I developed my greatest strengths from my challenges, as well as my tragedies. I am a survivor, and my life is now happier than I thought possible.\n\nFrom Now On was established with the vision to help others in need and to guide them through life’s challenges. Working together, I will share with you what life has taught me and help you to discover your path to happiness and fulfillment.','Who We Are','','inherit','open','open','','23-autosave','','','2012-02-01 12:32:42','2012-02-01 17:32:42','',23,'http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/23-autosave.html',0,'revision','',0);

Hypnosis can also be used to maximize skills (such as in sport), and of course, can be used as entertainment. Typically, people that seek the help of hypnosis will either want to be able to do something that they currently cannot do, or stop doing something that they currently do.\r\n\r\nHypnosis is also used for self-help, and self-improvement. With the development of self-hypnosis one might not even need a therapist any longer. Hypnosis is not a cure to one’s problems. It can be used for stress management, stress related disorders, dental and medical anxiety, in obstetrics and in some cases, as anaesthesia. It is also used for pain management in pain associated with cancer, as an adjunct to psychotherapy and in the management of a wide range of phobias, anxieties and other medical and psychological problems. Hypnosis can also change the subconscious programming by putting the power of the mind towards improving once life.\r\n\r\nHypnosis refers to a state or condition in which a person becomes highly responsive to suggestions. The hypnotized individual seems to follow instruction in an uncritical, automatic fashion and attends closely only to those aspects of the environment made relevant by the hypnotist. If the client is profoundly responsive, he or she hears, sees, feels, smells, and tastes in accordance with the suggestions given, even though these may be in direct contradiction to the actual stimuli that impinge upon the person. Furthermore, memory and awareness of self can be altered by suggestions. All of these effects may be extended post-hypnotically into the individual\'s subsequent walking activity.','Hypnosis','','publish','open','open','','hypnosis','','','2011-10-27 10:38:12','2011-10-27 14:38:12','',20,'http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/?page_id=70',6,'page','',0);

It is for women who have lost their sense of direction and compass and do not know what they want even though, by the account of society and their friends, they have it all. This book can help anyone who allured by comfort and luxury have given up knowing them selves and fulfill their purposes and destiny. This book will help women   recognize the signs of loosing oneself, but more importantly it will give them the courage to learn how to reclaim the true self.\r\n\r\n<strong>Summary</strong>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-118\" title=\"book-cover\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/book-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Trapped in a Diamond book\" width=\"235\" height=\"340\" />\r\n\r\nThis book is about the most profound loss one can experience, the loss of oneself.  It is the story of Vittoria who as a child was influenced by her parents’ values. Not felt loved as a child she searches for the ideal relationship, where she can give and receive unconditional love so missed during her childhood. As a young woman she develops her own values, forged by her fresh vision of the world, a desire for a just and loving world and her desire for harmony between races, creeds and social divides. Convinced about the righteousness of her own convictions, as only a young person can be, she adventures in a new world. She emigrates in a new country, meets a man from a different religion and country and she soon finds herself trading her principles for love. She is only 20 he is 28, he is a Muslim she is a catholic, she is educated, he is not. She is open-minded; he is a very conservative man. Strangely though love sips in the relationship blinded by passion, oblivious of contradictions. Her strong desire and need to be loved, accepted and valued, takes precedence over her own desire to evolve and grow. She marries and financial comfort and the allure of possessions distract her from who she was and who she likes to be. She adopts her husband’s values. For a long time she is bribed and blinded by the sparkle of the diamonds. But possessions don’t fill the emptiness she feels. She knows she is going against her purpose, her destiny. She knows she is giving up something very precious, something no diamond can fill.  She  justifies this ,thinking that she is putting  the needs and comforts of the family ahead of her principles and the only way to go on in this charade is to convince herself that she wants the same things her husband wants. It takes a long time before she realizes that by giving up her dreams and values she is disappearing and is metamorphosed into a complete stranger. She realizes that   her children deserve to know her and be influenced by her views even if they are in conflict with her husband’s. Events in her life force her to make drastic changes and after loosing something very precious she finally embarks in a journey of the soul.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe book is about her journey to reclaim herself and to find the courage to shed any attachment she still has to the shines of the diamonds. She does this to give rebirth to her true self.','Book: Trapped in a Diamond','','inherit','open','open','','114-revision-v1','','','2011-12-06 11:17:55','2011-12-06 16:17:55','',114,'http://fromnowon.ca/114-revision-11.html',0,'revision','',0);

Successes, however, are most often the result of the obstacles and challenges one must overcome. \r\n\r\nAt times in our lives, we find ourselves in a place where we are in need of some support. Someone to guide us through a difficult moment, someone to inspire us, someone to challenge us….or just someone to listen….with no judgement or prejudice.\r\n\r\nCounselling men and women, helping them discover their potential and their capacity to take life in their own hands, has been my life’s work and passion. \r\n\r\nAs someone who immigrated to Canada over forty years ago, involved in a bi-cultural marriage and raised two boys, I know from first-hand experience, the many barriers and challenges faced as a woman. The struggles of maintaining a “safe and happy home” combined with the need to educate myself and strike a professional career was not without hardship and personal sacrifice. \r\n\r\nAs the owner and operator of a private insurance brokerage, for over 15 years I have trained and coached my team to achieve their professional goals. In addition, through my involvement with COSTI Immigrant Services (www.costi.org), I have worked with abused and immigrant women in need of support and counselling. For many women and their families, group and individual counselling is their first step towards successful integration. As the organization’s Vice President and Chair of Women’s Services, my responsibility to ensure that programs are reflective of the needs of women, has resulted in the delivery of women’s services that focus on entrepreneurship and supportive self-help programs that lead to their independence, self-empowerment and success.\r\n\r\nAs a Life Coach, my goal is to assist individuals to achieve healthy and productive lives. Through my education, personal experience and professional training, my focus and mission is to help individuals heal and release any psychological obstacles that may prevent them from achieving their goals and living their dreams.\r\n\r\nMy experiences as a mother, widow, businesswoman and caregiver have shaped my perspective on life in that I find fulfillment in helping others actualize their dreams. I firmly believe that one can serve others better if one shares personal experiences. With all the joys in my life, I developed my greatest strengths from my challenges, as well as my tragedies. I am a survivor, and my life is now happier than I thought possible.\r\n\r\nFrom Now On was established with the vision to help others in need and to guide them through life’s challenges. Working together, I will share with you what life has taught me and help you to discover your path to happiness and fulfillment.','Who We Are','','inherit','open','open','','23-revision-3','','','2011-10-26 17:19:39','2011-10-26 21:19:39','',23,'http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/23-revision-3.html',0,'revision','',0);

It gives an overview and some profound insights into what makes the CFL Process so transformative.\r\n\r\n\"<strong>A Peaceful Divorce</strong>\" emphasizes the holistic approach of Collaborative Law by clearly laying out the roles of the lawyers, other team members and of course, the couple themselves. A number of Financial Professionals, Family Professionals and Life Coaches reveal how the CFL team approach saves time and money, and keeps the process moving by empowering everyone involved. It is designed to give a concise look at the logistics of the process, including the agreements that are made going in, leads to the final conclusion that CFL is revolutionary, offering a unique opportunity to transform the process of divorce and tailor it to suit each family\'s unique situation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a bonus video details why litigation almost inevitably increases the level of hostility between the parties, often turning the divorce into a war by forcing the children to choose between their parents. Then we see how the Collaborative Family Law Process protects children, so that as the marriage ends, the family is transformed, rather than destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis video is both a sales tool for potential clients, and also a reference for those same clients to refer back to, if and when they lose focus during the divorce itself. It becomes a timely reminder of the goals and outcomes that only CFL can provide.\r\n\r\nView a 2-minute clip of the video below.\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/sw6QkbqUN8Y?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n<!-- <object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"http://releases.flowplayer.org/swf/flowplayer-3.2.1.swf\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\">\r\n                          <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://releases.flowplayer.org/swf/flowplayer-3.2.1.swf\" />\r\n                          <param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" />\r\n                          <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"direct\" />\r\n                          <param name=\"flashVars\" value=\"config={\'playlist\':[\'http%3A%2F%2Fmissinglogo.com%2Fpcl%2Fvideo%2FCLV_Shot.png\',{\'url\':\'http%3A%2F%2Fmissinglogo.com%2Fpcl%2Fvideo%2FCLV_Promo.mp4\',\'autoPlay\':false}]}\" />\r\n                          <img alt=\"Collaborative Law\" src=\"http://missinglogo.com/pcl/video/CLV_Shot.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" title=\"No video playback capabilities, please download the video below\" />\r\n                        </object> -->\r\n<form action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"cmd\" value=\"_s-xclick\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"hosted_button_id\" value=\"5W2Z8WS8PETXY\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"referrer\" value=\"fromnowon.ca\">\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><td><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"on0\" value=\"Select Quantity Below\">Select Quantity Below</td></tr><tr><td><select name=\"os0\">\r\n	<option value=\"1 Video\">1 Video $15.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"2 Videos\">2 Videos $30.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"3 Videos\">3 Videos $45.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"5 Videos\">5 Videos $75.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"10 Videos\">10 Videos $120.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"15 Videos\">15 Videos $180.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"20 Videos\">20 Videos $240.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"30 Videos\">30 Videos $360.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"40 Videos\">40 Videos $480.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"50 Videos\">50 Videos $450.00</option>\r\n</select> </td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"currency_code\" value=\"CAD\">\r\n<input type=\"image\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_buynowCC_LG.gif\" border=\"0\" name=\"submit\" alt=\"PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!\">\r\n<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\r\n</form>','Collaborative Family Law Video','','publish','open','open','','a-peaceful-divorce-the-power-promise-of-collaborative-family-law-video','','','2014-10-23 20:28:07','2014-10-24 00:28:07','',29,'http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/?page_id=89',1,'page','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"500\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fQW6gTdRtE0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe></td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Workshop in Bari</h3>\r\n<a href=\"/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bari-foto2-e1414025601304.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-476\" title=\"bari foto2\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bari-foto2-e1414025601304-112x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"112\" height=\"150\" /></a><br><a href=\"/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bari3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-477\" title=\"bari3\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bari3-150x112.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Workshop at the eSpot</h3>\r\n<a href=\"/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/eSpot-1_1166.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-478 aligncenter\" title=\"eSpot 1_1166\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/eSpot-1_1166-150x112.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/eSpot_1165.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-479\" title=\"eSpot_1165\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/eSpot_1165-150x112.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>. Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history.

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\n\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\n\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\n\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\n\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\n\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\n[/tab]\n\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\n\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\n\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries.

Not felt loved as a child she searches for the ideal relationship, where she can give and receive unconditional love so missed during her childhood. As a young woman she develops her own values, forged by her fresh vision of the world, a desire for a just and loving world and her desire for harmony between races, creeds and social divides. Convinced about the righteousness of her own convictions, as only a young person can be, she adventures in a new world. She emigrates in a new country, meets a man from a different religion and country and she soon finds herself trading her principles for love.

Successes, however, are most often the result of the obstacles and challenges one must overcome.\r\n\r\nAt times in our lives, we find ourselves in a place where we are in need of some support. Someone to guide us through a difficult moment, someone to inspire us, someone to challenge us….or just someone to listen….with no judgement or prejudice.\r\n\r\nCounselling men and women, helping them discover their potential and their capacity to take life in their own hands, has been my life’s work and passion.\r\n\r\nAs someone who immigrated to Canada over forty years ago, involved in a bi-cultural marriage and raised two boys, I know from first-hand experience, the many barriers and challenges faced as a woman. The struggles of maintaining a “safe and happy home” combined with the need to educate myself and strike a professional career was not without hardship and personal sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAs the owner and operator of a private insurance brokerage, for about 20 years I have trained and coached my team to achieve their professional goals. In addition, through my involvement with COSTI Immigrant Services (<a href=\"http://www.costi.org\">www.costi.org</a>), I have worked with abused and immigrant women in need of support and counselling. For many women and their families, group and individual counselling is their first step towards successful integration. As the organization’s Vice President and Chair of Women’s Services, my responsibility to ensure that programs are reflective of the needs of women, has resulted in the delivery of women’s services that focus on entrepreneurship and supportive self-help programs that lead to their independence, self-empowerment and success.\r\n\r\nAs a Life Coach, my goal is to assist individuals to achieve healthy and productive lives. Through my education, personal experience and professional training, my focus and mission is to help individuals heal and release any psychological obstacles that may prevent them from achieving their goals and living their dreams.\r\n\r\nMy experiences as a mother, widow, businesswoman and caregiver have shaped my perspective on life in that I find fulfillment in helping others actualize their dreams. I firmly believe that one can serve others better if one shares personal experiences. With all the joys in my life, I developed my greatest strengths from my challenges, as well as my tragedies. I am a survivor, and my life is now happier than I thought possible.\r\n\r\nFrom Now On was established with the vision to help others in need and to guide them through life’s challenges. Working together, I will share with you what life has taught me and help you to discover your path to happiness and fulfillment.','Who We Are','','inherit','open','open','','23-revision-7','','','2011-12-10 16:48:00','2011-12-10 21:48:00','',23,'http://fromnowon.ca/23-revision-7.html',0,'revision','',0);

Its worth repeating that….\nYour thoughts come first and then feelings follow\nIt is simply not possible to have a feeling without the precursor of a thought. So when we tell ourselves “I can’t help the way that I feel, it’s just the way I am and there’s nothing I can do about it”, what we are actually doing is choosing to keep ourselves boxed into that negative mindset because they are the thoughts that we are choosing for ourselves.

It is for women who have lost their sense of direction and compass and do not know what they want even though, by the account of society and their friends, they have it all. This book can help anyone who allured by comfort and luxury have given up knowing them selves and fulfill their purposes and destiny. This book will help women   recognize the signs of loosing oneself, but more importantly it will give them the courage to learn how to reclaim the true self.\r\n\r\n<strong>Summary</strong>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-118\" title=\"book-cover\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/book-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Trapped in a Diamond book\" width=\"235\" height=\"340\" />\r\n\r\nThis book is about the most profound loss one can experience, the loss of oneself.  It is the story of Vittoria who as a child was influenced by her parents’ values. Not felt loved as a child she searches for the ideal relationship, where she can give and receive unconditional love so missed during her childhood. As a young woman she develops her own values, forged by her fresh vision of the world, a desire for a just and loving world and her desire for harmony between races, creeds and social divides. Convinced about the righteousness of her own convictions, as only a young person can be, she adventures in a new world. She emigrates in a new country, meets a man from a different religion and country and she soon finds herself trading her principles for love. She is only 20 he is 28, he is a Muslim she is a catholic, she is educated, he is not. She is open-minded; he is a very conservative man. Strangely though love sips in the relationship blinded by passion, oblivious of contradictions. Her strong desire and need to be loved, accepted and valued, takes precedence over her own desire to evolve and grow. She marries and financial comfort and the allure of possessions distract her from who she was and who she likes to be. She adopts her husband’s values. For a long time she is bribed and blinded by the sparkle of the diamonds. But possessions don’t fill the emptiness she feels. She knows she is going against her purpose, her destiny. She knows she is giving up something very precious, something no diamond can fill.  She  justifies this ,thinking that she is putting  the needs and comforts of the family ahead of her principles and the only way to go on in this charade is to convince herself that she wants the same things her husband wants. It takes a long time before she realizes that by giving up her dreams and values she is disappearing and is metamorphosed into a complete stranger. She realizes that   her children deserve to know her and be influenced by her views even if they are in conflict with her husband’s. Events in her life force her to make drastic changes and after loosing something very precious she finally embarks in a journey of the soul.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe book is about her journey to reclaim herself and to find the courage to shed any attachment she still has to the shines of the diamonds. She does this to give rebirth to her true self.','Book: Trapped in a Diamond','','inherit','open','open','','114-revision-v1','','','2012-01-05 01:51:30','2012-01-05 06:51:30','',114,'http://fromnowon.ca/114-revision-12.html',0,'revision','',0);

It gives an overview and some profound insights into what makes the CFL Process so transformative.\r\n\r\n\"<strong>A Peaceful Divorce</strong>\" emphasizes the holistic approach of Collaborative Law by clearly laying out the roles of the lawyers, other team members and of course, the couple themselves. A number of Financial Professionals, Family Professionals and Life Coaches reveal how the CFL team approach saves time and money, and keeps the process moving by empowering everyone involved. It is designed to give a concise look at the logistics of the process, including the agreements that are made going in, leads to the final conclusion that CFL is revolutionary, offering a unique opportunity to transform the process of divorce and tailor it to suit each family\'s unique situation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a bonus video details why litigation almost inevitably increases the level of hostility between the parties, often turning the divorce into a war by forcing the children to choose between their parents. Then we see how the Collaborative Family Law Process protects children, so that as the marriage ends, the family is transformed, rather than destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis video is both a sales tool for potential clients, and also a reference for those same clients to refer back to, if and when they lose focus during the divorce itself. It becomes a timely reminder of the goals and outcomes that only CFL can provide.\r\n\r\nView a 2-minute clip of the video below.\r\n\r\n<object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"http://releases.flowplayer.org/swf/flowplayer-3.2.1.swf\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\">\r\n                          <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://releases.flowplayer.org/swf/flowplayer-3.2.1.swf\" />\r\n                          <param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" />\r\n                          <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"direct\" />\r\n                          <param name=\"flashVars\" value=\"config={\'playlist\':[\'http%3A%2F%2Fmissinglogo.com%2Fpcl%2Fvideo%2FCLV_Shot.png\',{\'url\':\'http%3A%2F%2Fmissinglogo.com%2Fpcl%2Fvideo%2FCLV_Promo.mp4\',\'autoPlay\':false}]}\" />\r\n                          <img alt=\"Collaborative Law\" src=\"http://missinglogo.com/pcl/video/CLV_Shot.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" title=\"No video playback capabilities, please download the video below\" />\r\n                        </object>\r\n<form action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"cmd\" value=\"_s-xclick\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"hosted_button_id\" value=\"5W2Z8WS8PETXY\">\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><td><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"on0\" value=\"Select Quantity Below\">Select Quantity Below</td></tr><tr><td><select name=\"os0\">\r\n	<option value=\"1 Video\">1 Video $15.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"2 Videos\">2 Videos $30.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"3 Videos\">3 Videos $45.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"5 Videos\">5 Videos $75.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"10 Videos\">10 Videos $120.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"15 Videos\">15 Videos $180.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"20 Videos\">20 Videos $240.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"30 Videos\">30 Videos $360.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"40 Videos\">40 Videos $480.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"50 Videos\">50 Videos $450.00</option>\r\n</select> </td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"currency_code\" value=\"CAD\">\r\n<input type=\"image\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_buynowCC_LG.gif\" border=\"0\" name=\"submit\" alt=\"PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!\">\r\n<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\r\n</form>','Collaborative Family Law Video','','inherit','open','open','','89-revision-8','','','2011-11-17 16:40:24','2011-11-17 21:40:24','',89,'http://fromnowon.ca/89-revision-8.html',0,'revision','',0);
INSERT INTO `bo1e_posts` VALUES (187,2,'2011-11-30 10:20:20','2011-11-30 15:20:20','I love the quote form James Borg’s book Mind Power that goes ;\r\n<blockquote>Whether you’re an optimist or a pessimist may not affect the outcome. It’s just that the optimist has a better time in life”.</blockquote>\r\nSo what are you choosing to be and did you think you were born that way? Well no actually, that’s what you are choosing for yourself, because that’s the way you are choosing to think. Unless, of course, you are remotely controlled by some unknown life force? No…. I thought not.\r\n\r\nSo obviously if you are an optimist then well done and long may it continue. However if not, and you are a glass half empty kind of person, does it make you stop and wonder how you pulled the short straw…oops there it goes again!\r\n\r\nI give full credit to James Borg for what follows and I recommend you read his book in full, it’s a potential life changer.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to recount to you now is the key to the magic box where you can retrieve your subscription papers that declare lifelong membership to the Pessimists Club. Actually it’s not so much a key as a question really and it might just change the way you see yourself and the way you justify your thoughts and your feelings to yourself.\r\n\r\nThe key question is this:<strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Do you control your mind? Or do you let your mind control you?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe are all the product of what we think, from second to second, minute to minute the incessant commentary that we create as we talk to ourselves in our heads will lead us to the actions and then create the feelings that we experience. Its worth repeating that….<strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Your thoughts come first and then feelings follow.</strong>\r\n\r\nIt is simply not possible to have a feeling without the precursor of a thought. So when we tell ourselves “I can’t help the way that I feel, it’s just the way I am and there’s nothing I can do about it”, what we are actually doing is choosing to keep ourselves boxed into that negative mindset because they are the thoughts that we are choosing for ourselves. Some even argue for their weaknesses and list reasons why they can’t improve their life, such as “it’s my upbringing” “it’s my genes”, “it’s bad luck”.\r\n\r\nHowever these things, no matter how strong, can only ever be influences upon us, they do not determine us. We always have the ability to think differently and thereby improve ourselves and our responses to all that we encounter and experience. We cannot control what happens to us or how other people treat us but we always have the freedom to choose our mental and emotional response, our outlook and attitude.\r\n\r\nSo what are you choosing? Do you think of yourself as a pessimist?\r\n\r\nDon’t forget “<strong>”whether you’re an optimist or a pessimist, may not affect the outcome. It’s just that the optimist has a better time in life”.</strong>','Optimist or Pessimist?','','inherit','open','open','','168-revision-8','','','2011-11-30 10:20:20','2011-11-30 15:20:20','',168,'http://fromnowon.ca/168-revision-8.html',0,'revision','',0);

Not felt loved as a child she searches for the ideal relationship, where she can give and receive unconditional love so missed during her childhood. As a young woman she develops her own values, forged by her fresh vision of the world, a desire for a just and loving world and her desire for harmony between races, creeds and social divides. Convinced about the righteousness of her own convictions, as only a young person can be, she adventures in a new world. She emigrates in a new country, meets a man from a different religion and country and she soon finds herself trading her principles for love. She is only 20 he is 28, he is a Muslim she is a catholic, she is educated, he is not. She is open-minded; he is a very conservative man. Strangely though love sips in the relationship blinded by passion, oblivious of contradictions .Her strong desire and need to be loved, accepted and valued, takes precedence over her own desire to evolve and grow. She marries and financial comfort and the allure of possessions distract her from who she was and who she likes to be. She adopts her husband’s values. For a long time she is bribed and blinded by the sparkle of the diamonds. But possessions don’t fill the emptiness she feels. She knows she is going against her purpose, her destiny. She knows she is giving up something very precious, something no diamond can fill.  She  justifies this ,thinking that she is putting  the needs and comforts of the family ahead of her principles and the only way to go on in this charade is to convince herself that she wants the same things her husband wants. It takes a long time before she realizes that by giving up her dreams and values she is disappearing and is metamorphosed into a complete stranger. She realizes that   her children deserve to know her and be influenced by her views even if they are in conflict with her husband’s. Events in her life force her to make drastic changes and after loosing something very precious she finally embarks in a journey of the soul.\r\n\r\nThe book is about her journey to reclaim herself and to find the courage to shed any attachment she still has to the shines of the diamonds. She does this to give rebirth to her true self.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-118\" title=\"book-cover\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/book-cover.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"235\" height=\"340\" />\r\n\r\n<em>Trapped in a Diamond</em>.','Book: Trapped in a Diamond','','inherit','open','open','','114-revision-v1','','','2011-11-30 17:10:30','2011-11-30 22:10:30','',114,'http://fromnowon.ca/114-revision-8.html',0,'revision','',0);

For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out.

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fQW6gTdRtE0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>.

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out.

This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2013-01-07 21:14:59','2013-01-08 02:14:59','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-89.html',0,'revision','',0);

It is for women who have lost their sense of direction and compass and do not know what they want even though, by the account of society and their friends, they have it all. This book can help anyone who allured by comfort and luxury have given up knowing them selves and fulfill their purposes and destiny. This book will help women   recognize the signs of loosing oneself, but more importantly it will give them the courage to learn how to reclaim the true self.\r\n\r\n<strong>Summary</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-118\" title=\"book-cover\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/book-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Trapped in a Diamond book\" width=\"235\" height=\"340\" />\r\n\r\nThis book is about the most profound loss one can experience, the loss of oneself.  It is the story of Vittoria who as a child was influenced by her parents’ values. Not felt loved as a child she searches for the ideal relationship, where she can give and receive unconditional love so missed during her childhood. As a young woman she develops her own values, forged by her fresh vision of the world, a desire for a just and loving world and her desire for harmony between races, creeds and social divides.\r\n\r\nConvinced about the righteousness of her own convictions, as only a young person can be, she adventures in a new world. She emigrates in a new country, meets a man from a different religion and country and she soon finds herself trading her principles for love. She is only 20 he is 28, he is a Muslim she is a catholic, she is educated, he is not. She is open-minded; he is a very conservative man. Strangely though love sips in the relationship blinded by passion, oblivious of contradictions .Her strong desire and need to be loved, accepted and valued, takes precedence over her own desire to evolve and grow. She marries and financial comfort and the allure of possessions distract her from who she was and who she likes to be. She adopts her husband’s values. For a long time she is bribed and blinded by the sparkle of the diamonds. But possessions don’t fill the emptiness she feels. She knows she is going against her purpose, her destiny. She knows she is giving up something very precious, something no diamond can fill.  She  justifies this ,thinking that she is putting  the needs and comforts of the family ahead of her principles and the only way to go on in this charade is to convince herself that she wants the same things her husband wants.

At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court.

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/credentials/iacp\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-309\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309\" title=\"IACP\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IACP.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"99\" /></a>\r\n\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>.

For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-06-26 14:21:58','2012-06-26 18:21:58','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-35.html',0,'revision','',0);

Successes, however, are most often the result of the obstacles and challenges one must overcome.\r\n\r\nAt times in our lives, we find ourselves in a place where we are in need of some support. Someone to guide us through a difficult moment, someone to inspire us, someone to challenge us….or just someone to listen….with no judgement or prejudice.\r\n\r\nCounselling men and women, helping them discover their potential and their capacity to take life in their own hands, has been my life’s work and passion.\r\n\r\nAs someone who immigrated to Canada over forty years ago, involved in a bi-cultural marriage and raised two boys, I know from first-hand experience, the many barriers and challenges faced as a woman. The struggles of maintaining a “safe and happy home” combined with the need to educate myself and strike a professional career was not without hardship and personal sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAs the owner and operator of a private insurance brokerage, for about 20 years I have trained and coached my team to achieve their professional goals. In addition, through my involvement with COSTI Immigrant Services (<a href=\"http://www.costi.org\">www.costi.org</a>), I have worked with abused and immigrant women in need of support and counselling. For many women and their families, group and individual counselling is their first step towards successful integration. As the organization’s Vice President and Chair of Women’s Services, my responsibility to ensure that programs are reflective of the needs of women, has resulted in the delivery of women’s services that focus on entrepreneurship and supportive self-help programs that lead to their independence, self-empowerment and success.\r\n\r\nAs a Life Coach, my goal is to assist individuals to achieve healthy and productive lives. Through my education, personal experience and professional training, my focus and mission is to help individuals heal and release any psychological obstacles that may prevent them from achieving their goals and living their dreams.\r\n\r\nMy experiences as a mother, widow, businesswoman and caregiver have shaped my perspective on life in that I find fulfillment in helping others actualize their dreams. I firmly believe that one can serve others better if one shares personal experiences. With all the joys in my life, I developed my greatest strengths from my challenges, as well as my tragedies. I am a survivor, and my life is now happier than I thought possible.\r\n\r\nFrom Now On was established with the vision to help others in need and to guide them through life’s challenges.

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate.

You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history.

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries.

To this day, Canada continues to be a <a href=\"http://www.international.gc.ca/rights-droits/women-femmes/equality-egalite.aspx?view=d\">world-leader</a> in the promotion of women’s rights – but unfortunately, the business world hasn’t been quite so accommodating.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cba.org/cba/national/augsep03/cover.aspx\">A 2002 study</a> by Queen’s University professor Fiona Kay and University of Toronto professor John Hagan found that male lawyers are “consistently more likely” to be promoted to partners than women, regardless of experience or expertise. The study also found that female partners earn less than their male counterparts.\n\nThis is typical in many industries. In December, 2011, Sheila Copps, former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, penned <a href=\"http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=1416&amp;param=203\"><em>The Struggle for Equality in Parliament and Beyond</em></a><em>. </em>In it, she cites a report issued by Catalyst North America, which states that more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies do not have “a single woman” on their senior advisory board, despite the fact that female business graduates now outnumber men.\n\nCopps asserts that it doesn’t have to be this way, and I wholeheartedly agree.\n\nMy work involves counseling men and women by helping them discover their capacity to take life into their own hands. This has been my life’s work and passion and, as a woman who has had to battle sexism in the workplace, the topic of “equality” is one that is near and dear to my heart.\n\nWhile the politicians fight about gender equality on Parliament Hill, there are some things that you can do, as an individual, to help improve your career standing. I’d like to leave you with three tips – geared towards career-minded women – that will help raise your confidence in the workplace:\n<ol>\n	<li><strong>Lose your self-doubt. </strong>We women tend to over-analyze, and that can cause us to second-guess ourselves. Learn to trust your intuition and move forward with your decisions. A “take charge” attitude is rewarded in the corporate world. You already have the skills in your back pocket – now, you must learn to trust them.</li>\n	<li><strong>Learn to say “NO!”</strong> If you say “yes” to every offer that comes your way, you lessen the control you have over your time. Remember: Leadership is about quality and integrity, and these two things are impossible to maintain if you’ve taken on more than you can handle.</li>\n	<li><strong>Accept (and learn) from failure. </strong>Failure is a part of the corporate game, and you will experience it time and again, for the rest of your life. Learn to embrace failure and learn from the experience. Most – if not all – people find success by working hard and refusing to quit. It’s natural to want to give up when things get rough – but I urge you not to. If you keep your head down and continue to work hard, you will eventually be rewarded for it – I guarantee it.</li>\n</ol>\nI would love to continue this conversation with you. <a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/contact-us\">Contact me</a> if you’d like to learn more about building confidence in the workplace.','Don\'t waste your potential: Being a confident woman in the workplace','','inherit','open','open','','322-revision','','','2012-04-02 09:35:20','2012-04-02 13:35:20','',322,'http://fromnowon.ca/322-revision.html',0,'revision','',0);

This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-03-24 21:19:37','2012-03-25 01:19:37','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-29.html',0,'revision','',0);

Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-06-26 14:16:47','2012-06-26 18:16:47','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-30.html',0,'revision','',0);

Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion.

For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out.

This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries.

Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-06-26 14:20:00','2012-06-26 18:20:00','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-32.html',0,'revision','',0);

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them.

For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs. \r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter, </li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships, </li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and </li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-02-14 13:03:18','2012-02-14 18:03:18','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-25.html',0,'revision','',0);

Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups.

In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries.

This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant.

For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out.

Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n\r\n<strong>Training Context &amp; Overview</strong>\r\n\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems.

Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning.

Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-03-23 17:49:14','2012-03-23 21:49:14','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-26.html',0,'revision','',0);

To this day, Canada continues to be a <a href=\"http://www.international.gc.ca/rights-droits/women-femmes/equality-egalite.aspx?view=d\">world-leader</a> in the promotion of women’s rights – but unfortunately, the business world hasn’t been quite so accommodating.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cba.org/cba/national/augsep03/cover.aspx\">A 2002 study</a> by Queen’s University professor Fiona Kay and University of Toronto professor John Hagan found that male lawyers are “consistently more likely” to be promoted to partners than women, regardless of experience or expertise. The study also found that female partners earn less than their male counterparts.\r\n\r\nThis is typical in many industries. In December, 2011, Sheila Copps, former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, penned <a href=\"http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=1416&amp;param=203\"><em>The Struggle for Equality in Parliament and Beyond</em></a><em>. </em>In it, she cites a report issued by Catalyst North America, which states that more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies do not have “a single woman” on their senior advisory board, despite the fact that female business graduates now outnumber men.\r\n\r\nCopps asserts that it doesn’t have to be this way, and I wholeheartedly agree.\r\n\r\nMy work involves counseling men and women by helping them discover their capacity to take life into their own hands. This has been my life’s work and passion and, as a woman who has had to battle sexism in the workplace, the topic of “equality” is one that is near and dear to my heart.\r\n\r\nWhile the politicians fight about gender equality on Parliament Hill, there are some things that you can do, as an individual, to help improve your career standing. I’d like to leave you with three tips – geared towards career-minded women – that will help raise your confidence in the workplace:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Lose your self-doubt. </strong>We women tend to over-analyze, and that can cause us to second-guess ourselves. Learn to trust your intuition and move forward with your decisions. A “take charge” attitude is rewarded in the corporate world. You already have the skills in your back pocket – now, you must learn to trust them.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Learn to say “NO!”</strong> If you say “yes” to every offer that comes your way, you lessen the control you have over your time. Remember: Leadership is about quality and integrity, and these two things are impossible to maintain if you’ve taken on more than you can handle.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Accept (and learn) from failure. </strong>Failure is a part of the corporate game, and you will experience it time and again, for the rest of your life. Learn to embrace failure and learn from the experience. Most – if not all – people find success by working hard and refusing to quit. It’s natural to want to give up when things get rough – but I urge you not to. If you keep your head down and continue to work hard, you will eventually be rewarded for it – I guarantee it.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nI would love to continue this conversation with you. <a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/contact-us\">Contact me</a> if you’d like to learn more about building confidence in the workplace.','Don\'t waste your potential: Being a confident woman in the workplace','','publish','open','open','','dont-waste-your-potential-being-a-confident-woman-in-the-workplace-2','','','2014-10-22 13:46:19','2014-10-22 17:46:19','',0,'http://fromnowon.ca/?p=322',0,'post','',1);

Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2014-10-22 20:54:42','2014-10-23 00:54:42','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-92.html',0,'revision','',0);

Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2013-06-27 16:32:58','2013-06-27 20:32:58','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-90.html',0,'revision','',0);

This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time.

Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-07-30 10:38:58','2012-07-30 14:38:58','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-36.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/credentials/iacp\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-309\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309\" title=\"IACP\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IACP.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"99\" /></a>\r\n\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>. Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable.

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/credentials/iacp\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-309\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309\" title=\"IACP\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IACP.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"99\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<centre><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></centre>\r\n\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>. Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-08-03 09:59:42','2012-08-03 13:59:42','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-38.html',0,'revision','',0);

Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-08-03 09:59:42','2012-08-03 13:59:42','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-39.html',0,'revision','',0);

Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion.

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment.

Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-08-03 10:00:56','2012-08-03 14:00:56','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-41.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups.

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions.

For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-08-03 10:01:46','2012-08-03 14:01:46','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-43.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use.

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-08-03 10:02:51','2012-08-03 14:02:51','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-44.html',0,'revision','',0);

The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-08-03 10:02:51','2012-08-03 14:02:51','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-45.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion.

For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court.

This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention.

In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other.

Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-08-03 10:07:38','2012-08-03 14:07:38','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-48.html',0,'revision','',0);

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable.

For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-08-03 10:08:18','2012-08-03 14:08:18','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-50.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use.

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-08-03 10:08:58','2012-08-03 14:08:58','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-52.html',0,'revision','',0);

Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-08-03 10:08:59','2012-08-03 14:08:59','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-53.html',0,'revision','',0);

This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle.

Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole.

Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-08-03 10:09:42','2012-08-03 14:09:42','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-55.html',0,'revision','',0);

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable.

For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-08-03 10:10:32','2012-08-03 14:10:32','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-57.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" align=\"centre\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>.

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" align=\"centre\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>.

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-08-03 10:11:39','2012-08-03 14:11:39','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-59.html',0,'revision','',0);

Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n(<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from COSTI Immigration Services)\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-09-06 09:47:14','2012-09-06 13:47:14','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-60.html',0,'revision','',0);

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive.

Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-10-16 13:22:56','2012-10-16 17:22:56','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-64.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out.

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-09-06 14:29:43','2012-09-06 18:29:43','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-63.html',0,'revision','',0);

Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-10-16 13:22:56','2012-10-16 17:22:56','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-65.html',0,'revision','',0);

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment.

In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-10-16 13:25:47','2012-10-16 17:25:47','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-67.html',0,'revision','',0);

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention.

Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups.

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out.

This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-10-16 13:27:23','2012-10-16 17:27:23','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-68.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond.

Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-10-16 13:27:23','2012-10-16 17:27:23','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-69.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fQW6gTdRtE0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>. Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole.

The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fQW6gTdRtE0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>. Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-12-21 09:57:13','2012-12-21 14:57:13','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-80.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion.

For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life.

This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle.

Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/credentials/iacp\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-309\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309\" title=\"IACP\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IACP.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"99\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis workshop provides clear information on how, for centuries, our communication methods have been based on the \"rules of war,\" causing us to get defensive easily, creating destructive power struggles and much needless pain, even with those we love most. We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities.

Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/credentials/iacp\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-309\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309\" title=\"IACP\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IACP.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"99\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis workshop provides clear information on how, for centuries, our communication methods have been based on the \"rules of war,\" causing us to get defensive easily, creating destructive power struggles and much needless pain, even with those we love most. We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries.

This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-12-20 14:40:04','2012-12-20 19:40:04','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-79.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fQW6gTdRtE0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>.

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us.

Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/credentials/iacp\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-309\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309\" title=\"IACP\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IACP.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"99\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis workshop provides clear information on how, for centuries, our communication methods have been based on the \"rules of war,\" causing us to get defensive easily, creating destructive power struggles and much needless pain, even with those we love most. We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries.

In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-12-20 14:40:03','2012-12-20 19:40:03','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-78.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole.

This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible.

Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2012-12-20 14:38:28','2012-12-20 19:38:28','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-76.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history.

Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate.

Not felt loved as a child she searches for the ideal relationship, where she can give and receive unconditional love so missed during her childhood. As a young woman she develops her own values, forged by her fresh vision of the world, a desire for a just and loving world and her desire for harmony between races, creeds and social divides. Convinced about the righteousness of her own convictions, as only a young person can be, she adventures in a new world. She emigrates in a new country, meets a man from a different religion and country and she soon finds herself trading her principles for love. She is only 20 he is 28, he is a Muslim she is a catholic, she is educated, he is not. She is open-minded; he is a very conservative man. Strangely though love sips in the relationship blinded by passion, oblivious of contradictions. Her strong desire and need to be loved, accepted and valued, takes precedence over her own desire to evolve and grow. She marries and financial comfort and the allure of possessions distract her from who she was and who she likes to be. She adopts her husband’s values. For a long time she is bribed and blinded by the sparkle of the diamonds. But possessions don’t fill the emptiness she feels. She knows she is going against her purpose, her destiny. She knows she is giving up something very precious, something no diamond can fill.  She  justifies this ,thinking that she is putting  the needs and comforts of the family ahead of her principles and the only way to go on in this charade is to convince herself that she wants the same things her husband wants. It takes a long time before she realizes that by giving up her dreams and values she is disappearing and is metamorphosed into a complete stranger. She realizes that   her children deserve to know her and be influenced by her views even if they are in conflict with her husband’s. Events in her life force her to make drastic changes and after loosing something very precious she finally embarks in a journey of the soul.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe book is about her journey to reclaim herself and to find the courage to shed any attachment she still has to the shines of the diamonds. She does this to give rebirth to her true self.','Book: Trapped in a Diamond','','inherit','open','open','','114-revision-v1','','','2012-01-05 17:02:00','2012-01-05 22:02:00','',114,'http://fromnowon.ca/114-revision-14.html',0,'revision','',0);

For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2013-01-07 10:16:12','2013-01-07 15:16:12','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-85.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fQW6gTdRtE0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>.

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out.

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2013-01-07 10:12:44','2013-01-07 15:12:44','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-82.html',0,'revision','',0);

At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2013-01-07 10:12:44','2013-01-07 15:12:44','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-83.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fQW6gTdRtE0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>.

Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[titled_box title=\"Upcoming Seminars\" variation=\"silver\"]\r\n\r\nDecember 16 , 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nDecember 20, 2011 Carlsbad California USA\r\n\r\nFebruary 11, 2012 Toronto , Ontario Canada\r\n\r\nSpring 2012, Rome , Milan, Bologna, Naples, Bari, Italy[/titled_box]\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us.

This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle.

Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2013-01-07 10:23:08','2013-01-07 15:23:08','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-86.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fQW6gTdRtE0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>.

Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2013-01-07 10:23:09','2013-01-07 15:23:09','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-87.html',0,'revision','',0);

Not felt loved as a child she searches for the ideal relationship, where she can give and receive unconditional love so missed during her childhood. As a young woman she develops her own values, forged by her fresh vision of the world, a desire for a just and loving world and her desire for harmony between races, creeds and social divides. Convinced about the righteousness of her own convictions, as only a young person can be, she adventures in a new world. She emigrates in a new country, meets a man from a different religion and country and she soon finds herself trading her principles for love. She is only 20 he is 28, he is a Muslim she is a catholic, she is educated, he is not. She is open-minded; he is a very conservative man. Strangely though love sips in the relationship blinded by passion, oblivious of contradictions. Her strong desire and need to be loved, accepted and valued, takes precedence over her own desire to evolve and grow. She marries and financial comfort and the allure of possessions distract her from who she was and who she likes to be. She adopts her husband’s values. For a long time she is bribed and blinded by the sparkle of the diamonds. But possessions don’t fill the emptiness she feels. She knows she is going against her purpose, her destiny. She knows she is giving up something very precious, something no diamond can fill.  She  justifies this ,thinking that she is putting  the needs and comforts of the family ahead of her principles and the only way to go on in this charade is to convince herself that she wants the same things her husband wants. It takes a long time before she realizes that by giving up her dreams and values she is disappearing and is metamorphosed into a complete stranger. She realizes that   her children deserve to know her and be influenced by her views even if they are in conflict with her husband’s. Events in her life force her to make drastic changes and after loosing something very precious she finally embarks in a journey of the soul.\r\n\r\nThe book is about her journey to reclaim herself and to find the courage to shed any attachment she still has to the shines of the diamonds. She does this to give rebirth to her true self.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Vfv_T9htKBI\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>','Book: Trapped in a Diamond','','inherit','open','open','','114-revision-v1','','','2013-02-24 20:46:16','2013-02-25 01:46:16','',114,'http://fromnowon.ca/114-revision-22.html',0,'revision','',0);

INSERT INTO `bo1e_posts` VALUES (458,1,'2012-04-02 09:35:30','2012-04-02 13:35:30','It has been more than 40 years since the release of the <a href=\"http://www.swc-cfc.gc.ca/dates/roycom/index-eng.html\">Report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada</a>- a ground-breaking document that set the standard for equality in this country. To this day, Canada continues to be a <a href=\"http://www.international.gc.ca/rights-droits/women-femmes/equality-egalite.aspx?view=d\">world-leader</a> in the promotion of women’s rights – but unfortunately, the business world hasn’t been quite so accommodating.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cba.org/cba/national/augsep03/cover.aspx\">A 2002 study</a> by Queen’s University professor Fiona Kay and University of Toronto professor John Hagan found that male lawyers are “consistently more likely” to be promoted to partners than women, regardless of experience or expertise. The study also found that female partners earn less than their male counterparts.\r\n\r\nThis is typical in many industries. In December, 2011, Sheila Copps, former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, penned <a href=\"http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=1416&amp;param=203\"><em>The Struggle for Equality in Parliament and Beyond</em></a><em>. </em>In it, she cites a report issued by Catalyst North America, which states that more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies do not have “a single woman” on their senior advisory board, despite the fact that female business graduates now outnumber men.\r\n\r\nCopps asserts that it doesn’t have to be this way, and I wholeheartedly agree.\r\n\r\nMy work involves counseling men and women by helping them discover their capacity to take life into their own hands. This has been my life’s work and passion and, as a woman who has had to battle sexism in the workplace, the topic of “equality” is one that is near and dear to my heart.\r\n\r\nWhile the politicians fight about gender equality on Parliament Hill, there are some things that you can do, as an individual, to help improve your career standing. I’d like to leave you with three tips – geared towards career-minded women – that will help raise your confidence in the workplace:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Lose your self-doubt. </strong>We women tend to over-analyze, and that can cause us to second-guess ourselves. Learn to trust your intuition and move forward with your decisions. A “take charge” attitude is rewarded in the corporate world. You already have the skills in your back pocket – now, you must learn to trust them.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Learn to say “NO!”</strong> If you say “yes” to every offer that comes your way, you lessen the control you have over your time. Remember: Leadership is about quality and integrity, and these two things are impossible to maintain if you’ve taken on more than you can handle.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Accept (and learn) from failure. </strong>Failure is a part of the corporate game, and you will experience it time and again, for the rest of your life. Learn to embrace failure and learn from the experience. Most – if not all – people find success by working hard and refusing to quit. It’s natural to want to give up when things get rough – but I urge you not to. If you keep your head down and continue to work hard, you will eventually be rewarded for it – I guarantee it.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nI would love to continue this conversation with you. <a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/contact-us\">Contact me</a> if you’d like to learn more about building confidence in the workplace.','Don\'t waste your potential: Being a confident woman in the workplace','','inherit','open','open','','322-revision-2','','','2012-04-02 09:35:30','2012-04-02 13:35:30','',322,'http://fromnowon.ca/322-revision-2.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><td>\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fQW6gTdRtE0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<h3>Workshop in Bari</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Workshop at the eSpot</h3>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>. Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2014-10-22 20:52:11','2014-10-23 00:52:11','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-91.html',0,'revision','',0);

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle.

Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2014-10-22 21:06:23','2014-10-23 01:06:23','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-94.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2014-10-22 21:08:35','2014-10-23 01:08:35','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-95.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate.

Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2014-10-22 21:12:09','2014-10-23 01:12:09','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-97.html',0,'revision','',0);

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately.

Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable.

It gives an overview and some profound insights into what makes the CFL Process so transformative.\r\n\r\n\"<strong>A Peaceful Divorce</strong>\" emphasizes the holistic approach of Collaborative Law by clearly laying out the roles of the lawyers, other team members and of course, the couple themselves. A number of Financial Professionals, Family Professionals and Life Coaches reveal how the CFL team approach saves time and money, and keeps the process moving by empowering everyone involved. It is designed to give a concise look at the logistics of the process, including the agreements that are made going in, leads to the final conclusion that CFL is revolutionary, offering a unique opportunity to transform the process of divorce and tailor it to suit each family\'s unique situation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a bonus video details why litigation almost inevitably increases the level of hostility between the parties, often turning the divorce into a war by forcing the children to choose between their parents. Then we see how the Collaborative Family Law Process protects children, so that as the marriage ends, the family is transformed, rather than destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis video is both a sales tool for potential clients, and also a reference for those same clients to refer back to, if and when they lose focus during the divorce itself. It becomes a timely reminder of the goals and outcomes that only CFL can provide.\r\n\r\nView a 2-minute clip of the video below.\r\n\r\n<object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"http://releases.flowplayer.org/swf/flowplayer-3.2.1.swf\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\">\r\n                          <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://releases.flowplayer.org/swf/flowplayer-3.2.1.swf\" />\r\n                          <param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" />\r\n                          <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"direct\" />\r\n                          <param name=\"flashVars\" value=\"config={\'playlist\':[\'http%3A%2F%2Fmissinglogo.com%2Fpcl%2Fvideo%2FCLV_Shot.png\',{\'url\':\'http%3A%2F%2Fmissinglogo.com%2Fpcl%2Fvideo%2FCLV_Promo.mp4\',\'autoPlay\':false}]}\" />\r\n                          <img alt=\"Collaborative Law\" src=\"http://missinglogo.com/pcl/video/CLV_Shot.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" title=\"No video playback capabilities, please download the video below\" />\r\n                        </object>\r\n<form action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"cmd\" value=\"_s-xclick\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"hosted_button_id\" value=\"5W2Z8WS8PETXY\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"referrer\" value=\"fromnowon.ca\">\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><td><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"on0\" value=\"Select Quantity Below\">Select Quantity Below</td></tr><tr><td><select name=\"os0\">\r\n	<option value=\"1 Video\">1 Video $15.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"2 Videos\">2 Videos $30.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"3 Videos\">3 Videos $45.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"5 Videos\">5 Videos $75.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"10 Videos\">10 Videos $120.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"15 Videos\">15 Videos $180.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"20 Videos\">20 Videos $240.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"30 Videos\">30 Videos $360.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"40 Videos\">40 Videos $480.00</option>\r\n	<option value=\"50 Videos\">50 Videos $450.00</option>\r\n</select> </td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"currency_code\" value=\"CAD\">\r\n<input type=\"image\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_buynowCC_LG.gif\" border=\"0\" name=\"submit\" alt=\"PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!\">\r\n<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\r\n</form>','Collaborative Family Law Video','','inherit','open','open','','89-revision-9','','','2011-11-30 12:14:08','2011-11-30 17:14:08','',89,'http://fromnowon.ca/89-revision-9.html',0,'revision','',0);

Not felt loved as a child she searches for the ideal relationship, where she can give and receive unconditional love so missed during her childhood. As a young woman she develops her own values, forged by her fresh vision of the world, a desire for a just and loving world and her desire for harmony between races, creeds and social divides. Convinced about the righteousness of her own convictions, as only a young person can be, she adventures in a new world. She emigrates in a new country, meets a man from a different religion and country and she soon finds herself trading her principles for love. She is only 20 he is 28, he is a Muslim she is a catholic, she is educated, he is not. She is open-minded; he is a very conservative man. Strangely though love sips in the relationship blinded by passion, oblivious of contradictions. Her strong desire and need to be loved, accepted and valued, takes precedence over her own desire to evolve and grow. She marries and financial comfort and the allure of possessions distract her from who she was and who she likes to be. She adopts her husband’s values. For a long time she is bribed and blinded by the sparkle of the diamonds. But possessions don’t fill the emptiness she feels. She knows she is going against her purpose, her destiny. She knows she is giving up something very precious, something no diamond can fill.  She  justifies this ,thinking that she is putting  the needs and comforts of the family ahead of her principles and the only way to go on in this charade is to convince herself that she wants the same things her husband wants. It takes a long time before she realizes that by giving up her dreams and values she is disappearing and is metamorphosed into a complete stranger. She realizes that   her children deserve to know her and be influenced by her views even if they are in conflict with her husband’s. Events in her life force her to make drastic changes and after loosing something very precious she finally embarks in a journey of the soul.\r\n\r\nThe book is about her journey to reclaim herself and to find the courage to shed any attachment she still has to the shines of the diamonds. She does this to give rebirth to her true self.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/8MqltlikKQU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Vfv_T9htKBI\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe>','Book: Trapped in a Diamond','','inherit','open','open','','114-revision-v1','','','2014-10-16 18:35:07','2014-10-16 22:35:07','',114,'http://fromnowon.ca/114-revision-v1.html',0,'revision','',0);

Not felt loved as a child she searches for the ideal relationship, where she can give and receive unconditional love so missed during her childhood. As a young woman she develops her own values, forged by her fresh vision of the world, a desire for a just and loving world and her desire for harmony between races, creeds and social divides. Convinced about the righteousness of her own convictions, as only a young person can be, she adventures in a new world. She emigrates in a new country, meets a man from a different religion and country and she soon finds herself trading her principles for love. She is only 20 he is 28, he is a Muslim she is a catholic, she is educated, he is not. She is open-minded; he is a very conservative man. Strangely though love sips in the relationship blinded by passion, oblivious of contradictions. Her strong desire and need to be loved, accepted and valued, takes precedence over her own desire to evolve and grow. She marries and financial comfort and the allure of possessions distract her from who she was and who she likes to be. She adopts her husband’s values. For a long time she is bribed and blinded by the sparkle of the diamonds. But possessions don’t fill the emptiness she feels. She knows she is going against her purpose, her destiny. She knows she is giving up something very precious, something no diamond can fill.  She  justifies this ,thinking that she is putting  the needs and comforts of the family ahead of her principles and the only way to go on in this charade is to convince herself that she wants the same things her husband wants.

We often become controlling and manipulative, even when our intentions are \"good.\" Traditional methods of communication - across many lines of race, class, and culture - create breakdowns in our intimate relationships, undermine our competence at work, and inhibit us from solving the problems we face in both our local and global communities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> gives us the ability to interact with far more power, regardless of how others respond. Using non-defensive skills, we can speak with both honesty and compassion. The process can prompt others to drop their defenses, often simultaneously, opening the door to the kind of real conversation that can bring resolution to conflict and transform relationships.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the workshop, we\'ll look at how the physiology of defensiveness impacts us, six typical defensive modes people commonly use. Then we\'ll work with how to shift out of defensive reactions so: (a) our questions can be disarming instead of interrogating; (b) our feedback to others can convey wisdom instead of judgment; (c) our own expression of thoughts, feelings and beliefs can be honest, even passionate without trying to convince others to agree and/or alienating them: and (d) creating boundaries that prompt others to become more competent and reciprocal instead of feeling controlled.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll use discussion, story, mat work, exercises, role-playing (always voluntary) and practice in pairs or small groups. The methods learned can be applied to personal, professional, and/or community relationships and participants will walk away with skills that can be used immediately. The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"500\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fQW6gTdRtE0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe></td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Workshop in Bari</h3>\r\n<a href=\"/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bari-foto2-e1414025601304.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-476\" title=\"bari foto2\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bari-foto2-e1414025601304-112x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"112\" height=\"150\" /></a><br><a href=\"/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bari3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-477\" title=\"bari3\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bari3-150x112.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Workshop at the eSpot</h3>\r\n<a href=\"/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/eSpot-1_1166.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-478 aligncenter\" title=\"eSpot 1_1166\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/eSpot-1_1166-150x112.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/eSpot_1165.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-479\" title=\"eSpot_1165\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/eSpot_1165-150x112.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>. Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-revision-v1','','','2014-10-22 21:14:25','2014-10-23 01:14:25','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-revision-v1.html',0,'revision','',0);

The pace is fast and fun while the content goes deep.\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"500\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mzmyrlyn4II\" height=\"360\" width=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fQW6gTdRtE0\" height=\"360\" width=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Workshop in Bari</h3>\r\n<a href=\"/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bari-foto2-e1414025601304.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-476\" title=\"bari foto2\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bari-foto2-e1414025601304-112x150.jpg\" width=\"112\" height=\"150\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bari3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-477\" title=\"bari3\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bari3-150x112.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Workshop at the eSpot</h3>\r\n<a href=\"/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/eSpot-1_1166.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-478 aligncenter\" title=\"eSpot 1_1166\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/eSpot-1_1166-150x112.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/eSpot_1165.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-479\" title=\"eSpot_1165\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/eSpot_1165-150x112.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n[tabs_vertical]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Lawyers\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Lawyers</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-107 alignright\" title=\"workshop-photo-1\" alt=\"Workshop for Lawyers\" src=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/workshop-photo-1-300x169.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />Vittoria is a member of the <strong>Peel Halton Collaborative Practice Group</strong> <a href=\"http://peelcollaborative.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external nofollow\">http://peelcollaborative.com/</a>. Vittoria is a <a href=\"http://www.fromnowon.ca/\">Life &amp; Divorce Coach, Mediator and Relationship Expert</a>. Vittoria has been trained by <strong>Sharon Strand Ellison</strong> to be a trainer of the PNDC model.\r\n\r\nDuring the training workshop, family professionals, financial professionals and lawyers, will learn about the costs of using the “Rules of War” as the basis for how we talk to each other in both professional and personal relationships. For lawyers, who are involved in litigation, adversarial relationships are part and parcel of everyday life. At the same time, the cost of litigation has become so high resulting in more and more self represented individuals being in court. The cost of litigation also includes the cost to clients, both financially and emotionally. And, for litigation counsel the cost is sometimes so high it contributes to burn out. For those professionals including lawyers who are involved in the collaborative process, traditional communication methods can often make facilitating conflict resolution exceedingly difficult and be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn about the physiology of defensiveness, and learn new methods for enhancing honest, genuine dialogue, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback while conveying respect rather than judgment,</li>\r\n	<li>stating opinions with clarity and power, while creating understanding rather than polarizing parties, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that increase respect and accountability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nProfessionals in every field will leave with skills that can be used immediately to transform interactions with individuals and families in crisis, as well as with other professionals.\r\n\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 Professionalism Hours\r\nThis program has been accredited by the Law Society for 6 New Member CPD Hours\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Financial Services Professionals\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Financial Services Professionals</h2>\r\nFinancial advisors, whether working in major institutions, small businesses, or independently, are often in the position of advising clients who have unrealistic ideas about what is possible in terms of achieving their financially related goals, and thus, may be resistant to advice. This is true regardless of the financial realm, which may be investment, business or personal loans, tax issues, retirement planning, wills, trusts, or financial issues related to divorce. In many cases, conflicts between couples or among business partners may add additional layers of conflict, defensiveness, and power struggle. Having non-defensive communication skills can give financial advisors vital tools needed to move past conflict and empower clients to make wise decisions.\r\n\r\nFor those who work in larger financial institutions, the cost of poor communication is also high in terms of employee relationships, job satisfaction, performance and retention. In Vittoria Adhami’s training programs, she clearly outlines the dynamics of defensiveness and then presents methods of communication that can be used to diffuse power struggles, whether subtle or blatant. While financial planners do not necessarily have a background in communication, the skills presented will give options for (a) asking questions that get at underlying issues, (b) giving feedback so that clients feel respected and listen, (c) stating opinions clearly without getting bogged down trying to convince clients of the wisdom of the advice, and (d) setting clear boundaries so clients take more accountability and make increasingly competent decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing these skills, financial planners can guide clients in a decision making process that will bring them the best benefit, while honoring their value systems. In the short and long run, the client relationships work more smoothly and clients are more likely to respect the wisdom of the financial advisor, creating good word of mouth advertizing.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Parents/Family\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Parents/Family</h2>\r\nAs parents, the love and responsibility we feel can make us afraid about how to make the best decisions for our children—and how much to expect of them. Many parents currently are making a huge effort to communicate effectively and create a family life where children and teens are motivated to be cooperative, rather than coerced. Sadly, in far too many cases, parents try to get cooperation without setting clear boundaries. Then when they don\'t get the response they want, they either give up or express frustration with the child, sometimes indirectly, other times directly, with periodic anger, blame and/or orders.\r\nUsing traditional communication methods, parents tend to chose, sometimes moment by moment, between being supportive and exerting some kind of control over the child’s behavior and attitude. Despite best efforts, parents can end up being defensive and in power struggle with their children at almost any age. To create an environment where children are responsive, competent, respectful, appreciative, and above all, genuinely happy, requires a delicate balance.\r\n\r\nA major part of the problem is that we’ve used the “rules of war” as the basis for verbal interactions. Beliefs deeply rooted in the War Model for communication not only result in some parents choosing to be authoritarian, they also motivate others—in an effort to be democratic and more cooperative—to go to the other extreme and become too permissive. Probably the majority of parents fluctuate between the two. All of these uses of authority can impact the child’s character by inhibiting the development of emotional, intellectual, and ethical maturity, and/or behavioral competence.\r\n\r\nParents, foster parents, kinship providers, and others who work with children can learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new system that offers tools for simultaneously and consistently expressing love within the context of clear boundaries. Participants will learn four specific, detailed skill sets:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Limit Setting</strong>: How to shift form with not setting clear limits and/or setting limits that make children and teens feel punished—to setting limits that prompt children to take accountability and develop the ability to become reciprocal.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Questions</strong>: How to shift from asking questions that make young people feel interrogated—to asking disarming questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Giving Feedback</strong>: How to shift from giving feedback in ways that are indirect or judgmental—to a three-part process that prompts children and teens to be more likely to listen, even perhaps seek advice.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Statements - Self-Expression</strong>: How to shift from expressing your own thoughts, feelings and beliefs in ways that make young people feel lectured—to ways that create bonds of understanding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese skills are invaluable. Without them, it’s harder than you might think to tell when a child or teen is manipulating and when the feelings they express are real. Using the skills learned, parents are often moved to tears by the genuine heartfelt responses they get from not only young children, but teens as well. Parents and and other caregivers will learn how to create the boundaries that give children the limits they need to internalize security and love in balance with the freedom they need to grow as individuals.\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Couples\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Couples</h2>\r\nIn long-term relationships, it can be a struggle to maintain the kind of intimacy that often draws people together in the beginning. Independence is often lost as well, for one or both parties. When a couple has children, the stress on the relationship becomes intensified. In order for a relationship to mature without losing its joy and passion, both intimacy and independence must become, if anything, stronger, rather than weaker.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Powerful Non-Defensive Communication</strong> workshops couples can learn how traditional communication methods damage the potential for creating relationships that thrive. You can learn how to maintain openness and vulnerability even during hard times when trust may be damaged, as well as how to set boundaries that maintain both independence and self-esteem.\r\nTraditional communication is build on the “rules of war,” so defensiveness is our primary self-protective response. Most people have also learned that to be open and vulnerable requires trust first. When you love someone deeply and anything happens to damage trust, the wounds can go deep, quickly. Then, showing vulnerability isn’t considered “safe” and the defenses can come up instantly. Far from protecting, it creates a kind of alienation that can become increasingly pervasive in the relationship.\r\n\r\nOur common ways of communicating also increase the likelihood that one or both parties in a relationship will start out trying to “please” each other, setting a precedent for not having clear boundaries. Trade-offs happen, where both parties give up core needs. Each person can end up feeling both betrayed and controlled by the other to varying degrees.\r\nIf couples can work through disagreement or crisis in ways that actually strengthen trust, the relationship can mature with love that deepens over time. Learning Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills can give couples the tools they need to show vulnerability balanced by integrity in setting clear boundaries. This process allows couples to be genuinely reciprocal. Each person can fulfill her or his potential, while achieving profound intimacy as a couple\r\n[/tab]\r\n\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Community Organizations\"]\r\n<h2>Workshop for Community Organizations</h2>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://fromnowon.ca/wp-draft1-s/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3569_001.pdf\">Click here</a></strong> to read a full letter of recommendation from Mario Calla, Executive Director, COSTI Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that support our communities are the lifeblood of the community, whether they offer environments for networking and building businesses, seeking spiritual growth, mentoring young people, providing resources for those in need, creating social change, and/or providing entertainment. Unfortunately, community organizations can be torn apart by internal strife. Beyond that, informal groups as well as organized ones with different values and goals can be in varying degrees of conflict with each other. The degree to which community organizations and sub-cultures can not only live in peace together, but build on each other’s strength will determine the vitality of the community as a whole. Using non-defensive communication is vital to such community building, within and among organizations.\r\n\r\nVittoria Adhami demonstrates how traditional communication methods, across lines of race, class and culture, have been built on the “rules of war,\" so people get defensive instantly when they feel misunderstood, negated, criticized or “under attack” in any way. Essentially, the very way we communicate systematically creates and accelerates conflict. Whether we react passively or aggressively, our defensive reactions lead directly to power struggle. Using these traditional methods for communication, we have shaped human interactions at all levels— personal, professional, and in our local and global communities. Now that we are living in communities that are increasingly diverse, this old system of communication leads quickly to polarization of individuals and groups with cultures needs and/or cultures.\r\n\r\nIn Vittoria Adhami’s keynotes, public speeches, workshops, and training programs, you will learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication, a new paradigm for listening and speaking in ways that can eliminate defensiveness . Using the skills learned, people in community together can practice the kind of genuine dialogue where individuals can speak honestly and take accountability. This kind of dialogue is a foundation for building bridges of understanding, creating strong bonds across lines of difference, and achieving the kind of creative problem-solving that makes community organizations strong and flexible. This, in turn adds strength to the community as a whole. You will learn to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ask questions that get at the heart of an issue quickly and prompt others to respond sincerely and openly,</li>\r\n	<li>Give honest feedback without conveying judgment so others are more willing to listen,</li>\r\n	<li>Express opinions clearly and strongly while building bridges of understanding, and</li>\r\n	<li>Set boundaries that increase competence reciprocity and mutual respect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeyond simply learning isolated communication \"techniques,” participants will have an opportunity to change habitual mind-sets that keep us locked into defensive patterns as well as leaving with skills they can use immediately to engage in genuine, spontaneous, heartfelt conversations.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[tab title=\"Workshop for Spiritual Communities\"]\r\n<h2>Workshops for Spiritual Communities</h2>\r\nOur spiritual growth is deeply impacted by how we communicate. Traditional methods of communication can block our potential for \"walking our talk\" —i.e., living out our ethics in our intimate and professional relationships, as well as in community. You can learn how to have internal dialogues that balance self-acceptance with self-examination. You can gain skills for expressing your beliefs passionately, without judgment, honoring each person’s humanity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, you will learn about how the physiology of defensiveness impacts all of us. You\'ll then have an opportunity to learn how we can use power in our interactions in new ways, more in keeping with our spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nParticipants will then learn Powerful Non-Defensive Communication skills for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asking questions that get quickly to the core of a matter,</li>\r\n	<li>giving honest feedback that creates stronger relationships,</li>\r\n	<li>having different opinions and beliefs without being adversarial, and</li>\r\n	<li>creating boundaries that enhance respect and reciprocity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou will learn how to interact with others without getting defensive no matter how they respond. Vittoria uses story to weave together the principles, as well as role-play and practice in longer sessions.\r\n\r\nLearning these skills can give people in spiritual communities the ability to be both honest and compassionate with each other. Others often drop their own defenses in response, so the process is contagious. The skills are a potent tool for creating justice, for healing the violence that has pervaded human history. If we use a different paradigm for language, we can maximize our potential for creating strong spiritual communities that contribute to making peace a contagious process.\r\n\r\n[/tab]\r\n[/tabs_vertical]','Workshops','','inherit','open','open','','100-autosave-v1','','','2015-08-25 14:27:48','2015-08-25 18:27:48','',100,'http://fromnowon.ca/100-autosave-v1.html',0,'revision','',0);
